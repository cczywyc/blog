This repository is my [website](https://cczywyc.com) file

my blog powered by [Hexo](https://hexo.io/), use the theme is [Butterfly](https://github.com/jerryc127/hexo-theme-butterfly)

## Get Started
> Note: All the articles inside the _posts folder are my blog articles. You should use your own blog articles instead.

This repository only contains archives of articles and configuration files for my website, and it needs to be compiled by the hexo and deployed using tools such as nginx.

### install node and npm
The operation of Hexo requires the use of Node, so you need to install the Node and npm environment first. <br />
If you want to use pnpm, you can install it using the following command.
```shell
npm install -g pnpm
```

### install hexo
```shell
npm install hexo-cli -g
```

### init the blog
After installing Hexo, use Hexo to initialize the blog folder. <br />
For example:
```shell
hexo init blog
cd blog
```

### install theme
```shell
git clone -b master https://github.com/jerryc127/hexo-theme-butterfly.git themes/butterfly
```

### clone the articles and configuration files
```shell
rm -rf source _config.yml _config.butterfly.yml package.json
git clone https://github.com/cczywyc/blog.git .
mv package.json.txt package.json
```

### install the dependency
```shell
npm install
npm server
```
now you can open http://localhost:4000 to preview the website.

### deploy
The website generated by Hexo can be deployed on GitHub Pages or Cloudflare Pages, and it can also be deployed on a server with the help of Nginx.
```shell
npm deploy
```
Finally, you will get a "public" folder generated by Hexo. Deploy this static webpage file to complete the process.
